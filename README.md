# TeamWork Project API for Node.js

The purpose of this software is to turn the TeamWork Restful APIs more acessible and developer-friendly. To turn it possible, was created a wrapper containing the promise-based CRUD functions, allowing you to handle your projects, tasks, milestones, and everything else inside TeamWork Projects.  
  
This software is still under development and many of the desired APIs are currently being implemented. Please, consider being patient, or submiting your pull request with new features and/or improvements.  
  
Please, considerar that if TeamWork change their Restful API, this software can break.
